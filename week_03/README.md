This subdirectory has code for building a bar chart of COVID cases as we did in class and a bar chart of Chicago Public Library visits for homework.

This subdirectory also contains some preliminary data files for my final project. At the moment I am thinking about looking at national transit data from the 2020 ACS estimates, perhaps compared with previous years. I looked at transit data in South Bend, IN during my internship this summer and would be interested in further investigations at a national level. I think this data will lend itself to both maps and to other visualizations comparing commutes across age, sex, and location.

This is primary data, although since it is from the ACS it is statistically estimated from samples, unlike the full census.

Census Bureau data source: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/all?q=Commuting&g=0100000US&y=2020&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Detailed%20Tables (national data)

I am considering, however, using this project as an opportunity to explore something fun outside of my normal policy interests. So, I might change my mind and upload different data.
