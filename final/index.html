            Water is essential to life. It is for that reason that it is often one of the first things to suffer during 
            conflict. In political strife or full-on war, purposefully weaponized or accidentally destroyed, lack of 
            access to this resource places immense stress on victims of conflict. In turn, water can be a major factor 
            among the causes of displaced populations and refugees.<br><br>

            In the Arab World, particularly the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), many countries are 
            predominantly arid or desert. Water is naturally a stressed resource, requiring careful management, 
            extensive infrastructure, or diplomacy. For example, Israel has constructed extensive transport canals 
            and irrigation systems that allow it to use water in trade with neighboring Jordan.<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02508060.2019.1607479">[1]</a> The situation has been 
            exacerbated by the continuing effects of climate change and by the civil wars and unrest which have spread 
            throughout the region since the Arab Spring in 2011.<br><br>
            
            This page explores data related to MENA refugees and water conflicts between 2010 and 2022. It will seek to 
            elucidate if there is an observable relationship between water-related conflicts and refugee numbers, or if 
            water issues only exert an indirect effect.

                <h3>The refugee crisis in the Middle East</h3>
                <p>
                    This crisis is well known, especially from the highly publicized controversies over European 
                    migration laws and policies during its peak. Although unrest had been fomenting in some Arab countries
                    since the mid-2000s or long before, I am focusing on the most recent decade. During this period, the
                    world saw multiple revolutions overthrow dictatorial regimes, although only Tunisia has approached
                    success in maintaining the changes. The aftershocks of the Arab Spring led to civil wars in Libya, Yemen,
                    and Syria, with two of the three ongoing. Lastly, it was during this decade that ISIS/ISIL strove for
                    power, creating more conflict and tying into the Syrian civil war.<br><br>

                    The scatterplot to the right graphs the number of refugees who claim each country as their country of
                    origin, vs. the number of refugees who are in the country for asylum. Many countries remain in a smaller
                    cluster, while Syria and Yemen in particular show a jump between the earlier (yellow) years and later (red)
                    years. As an aside, take note that the axes are logarithmically scaled.

                    Continuing to look at refugee flows, or the number of new refugees recorded entering a country, we can
                    observe how much each country's contribution varies by year. As the Syrian civil war escalated, for instance,
                    the neighboring countries began to receive more and more refugees. Likewise, we can see the periods of greater conflict
                    for Yemen and Iraq, although Yemeni refugees did not tend to go to their direct neighbors as much. One point of
                    interest is internally displaced people, for example in Iraq in 2016 or Lebanon and Jordan in 2022. This may be due to
                    independent reasons, or these may be refugees originally from another country who have once again lost their homes.

                <h3>How does water affect refugees?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Pacific Institute's Water Conflict Chronology classifies conflicts according to the role water 
                    plays: a casualty, trigger, or weapon. Casualties are by far the most common. Since water resource 
                    and infrastructure are central to population centers, they are at high risk for damage from 
                    missiles/bombing and other conflicts. These casualties can take a number of forms: it may lead to 
                    complete disruption of water access, with dire implications for agriculture and hydration. However, 
                    it can also lead to contamination of water supplies. Among the effects of the Yemeni civil war was a 
                    severe cholera epidemic caused by a lack of safe water sources.<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/an-update-on-yemen-s-water-crisis-and-the-weaponization-of-water/">[2]</a><br><br>
                    
                    Instances where water is a trigger are generally protests or riots related to current drought 
                    conditions and water shortages, or over planned/threatened service cuts. In some cases this 
                    escalates into further conflict, including armed conflict. Weaponization of water often corresponds 
                    to a battle over strategic water infrastructure points, like a source or a dam. It can also include 
                    deliberately cutting off or destroying water access, such as in besieged cities. One drastic example 
                    of water as a weapon was the draining of the Mesopotamian marshes in Iraq by Saddam Hussein, with the 
                    intention of driving out and destroying the way of life for the traditional inhabitants of that area.<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13818691-800-draining-life-from-iraqs-marshes-saddam-hussein-is-using-an-old-idea-to-force-the-marsh-arabs-from-their-home/">[3]</a><br><br>
                    
                    While most water conflicts will not produce refugees as intentionally as this environmental 
                    disaster in the Iraqi marshes, they bring instability to daily life. The risk of failing farms, 
                    disease, or simply running out of drinking water can strongly motivate - or force - people to migrate.<a href="https://lawecommons.luc.edu/lucilr/vol16/iss1/6/?utm_source=lawecommons.luc.edu%2Flucilr%2Fvol16%2Fiss1%2F6&utm_medium=PDF&utm_campaign=PDFCoverPages">[4]</a> 
                    Over the past decade, we can see that countries with the most water conflicts correspond to some of 
                    the countries with the highest numbers of refugees. The civil wars in Yemen, Libya, and Syria, as well 
                    as the war against ISIS/ISIL in Syria and Iraq, show up in high numbers of water casualties. Palestine 
                    also suffered many water-related casualties. Although conflict in the past decade has predominantly 
                    occurred in the Gaza Strip, such as the 2014 Gaza war, the majority of water events reported were in 
                    the West Bank and involved Palestinians and Israeli settlers clashing over expansion. These events 
                    included destruction of individual buildings and orchards. In some cases, the Israeli military was 
                    also involved.

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                    The scatterplot to the right graphs number of refugees from each country over the 12-year 
                    timespan against the number of water-related conflicts. Despite the correlation of countries 
                    with many conflicts and many refugees observed above, there does not appear to be a strong 
                    relationship between the two datasets. In particular, for the five countries with the most 
                    conflicts (which are also most easily visible on this graph), Syria does not show any apparent 
                    linear trend, while Iraq, Yemen, Palestine, and Libya demonstrate shallow slopes. Further 
                    exploring each country with the visualization below, we can observe the refugee trends 
                    corresponding with revolutions and war. However, although in some instances the water conflicts 
                    and spikes in refugee numbers line up, it is neither consistent nor dramatic enough to suggest a 
                    direct effect of water conflicts on refugee movements.

                    Thus I conclude that there is not a direct relationship between refugees and water conflicts. 
                    Instead, based on the datasets available we can only characterize both as effects of the underlying 
                    political instability and warfare in the MENA region.

                    Stepping briefly into personal reflections on this result, while I did not expect either to find or not
                    find a relationship, I am disappointed that there was not one. Climate-related migration and refugeeism
                    is a relatively unrecognized and unprotected category of migration, yet it is expected to continue
                    rising due to climate change. From sea level rise displacing coastal populations, to droughts and
                    heat waves preventing agriculture, to increasing salinity of groundwater, the potential environmental
                    motivations for refugees keep becoming more severe. In the face of slow adaptation and mitigation
                    measures, the least governments can do to support these populations is give them the protection they
                    deserve and recognize the reasons for their movement.
