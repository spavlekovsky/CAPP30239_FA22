        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            Protection of our environment and natural resources, including water, is one of my long-standing interests, and 
            so I wanted to choose a topic that would explore some aspect of the environment. The specific focus on water 
            conflicts was inspired by the course
            <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/programs-degrees/courses/hydropolitics-water-policy-and-conflict-spring-2023">Hydropolitics</a>
            taught by <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/michael-tiboris">Dr. Michael Tiboris</a>, which I took
            in Spring 2022 and owe for many of my sources. I wanted to fill a gap in my experience of the course: our 
            discussions of water-related conflicts and the impact on refugees lacked data visualizations. I also was 
            interested in a topic relating to the Arab World, which would be relevant for a translation into Arabic 
            (coming soon).<br><br>

            I found my data via the <a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com">Data is Plural</a> archives. Data is Plural 
            released <a href="https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2021-07-07-edition/">a water politics edition</a> in 
            July 2021, listing multiple databases of water conflicts. In addition, they included a 
            <a href="https://ifi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sdgs_wp_2020_wada_en.pdf">report comparing the 
            different sources</a>, which I used as a guideline for my selection. Main criteria were ease of use and 
            timescale, since I had decided to focus on the last decade (post-Arab Spring). I used a dataset collected by 
            the <a href="https://pacinst.org">Pacific Institute</a>, an environmental NGO with a special focus on water. 
            They publish a <a href="https://www.worldwater.org/water-conflict/">Water Conflict Chronology</a> with 
            conflicts pulled from research and, more recently, journalism. I used refugee data from the 
            <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> 
            data finder and the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank Open Data</a> portal. There are a 
            multitude of sources for refugee-related data and the definitions used by this data, including definitions in 
            the two sources I used. One challenge I have faced is understanding the differences between the datasets and 
            when each will be more applicable. However, I selected these datasets again based on ease of use filtering the 
            data and the options presented. The World Bank dataset gives total numbers, or stocks, of refugees in each 
            country. Meanwhile, the UN data goes further in detail with country of origin and asylum, which can 
            approximate refugee “flows” between countries. There is no missing data apparent in these two datasets, 
            though there may be errors related to data collection due to political situations or other circumstances. 
            However, there is missing data in the sense that some Palestinian refugees fall under the purview of a 
            different organization, the UN Relief and Works Agency, which collects its own data. I have not identified 
            any ethical considerations, since there is no personal information about refugees besides country of origin and 
            UN refugee type classification.<br><br>

            I had expected (or hoped for) a clearer story with my data, but when a clear relationship did not appear, 
            I pivoted my topic to have more of an exploratory, questioning framework. In essence, I wish to present two 
            stories: one about where refugees are and have been in the Middle East and North Africa, and one about 
            water-related conflicts in the region. Then, I brought the two stories together to see what conclusions 
            might be drawn.<br><br>
            
            I chose a scatterplot for the first chart relating to refugees in order to show the refugee stocks for country 
            of origin and asylum. Displaying all years and all countries at the same time, it lets the viewer observe how 
            some countries have stayed at similar levels while others changed dramatically, and in particular if the 
            number of refugees from a country changed more or less than the number of asylum-seekers/-holders in the 
            country. I was unsure if a linear scale or log scale would be more confusing, but decided to use a log scale
            so that there would be less white space in the middle. I am still not 100% convinced that that was the correct
            choice. The second chart was chosen to capitalize on the idea of refugee flows, calculated simply as the 
            change in numbers of refugees. It is not exactly complete information, since I was only able to show new 
            refugees coming into a country and not refugees leaving (negative changes). While the exact numbers are 
            not as apparent from this chart type (without the mouseover), it is clear to see how different countries 
            contributed more or less in certain years to the number of refugees.<br><br>

            The third chart, for water conflicts, is a stacked bar chart because I wanted to show both different 
            categories and the overall number. I also considered grouped bars. A challenge with this plot was one 
            “outlier” data point, Yemen. If I displayed the full height, the other countries would be dwarfed and 
            difficult to read, so I decided to let it go off the chart and hope a reader would notice from the 
            caption/tooltip. I would like to include a map as well showing number of conflicts, potentially by year.<br><br>

            Combining the data, I used a scatterplot in order to make it very apparent if there was any sort of 
            relationship. Most countries appear to have a slope of 0, but it is also difficult to read the plot due 
            to the wide spread of refugee numbers and the clumping of points near the origin. A future improvement 
            would be adding scrollable functionality. This plot allows the reader to see every country at once, but 
            to add clarity I made the fifth plot for individual countries. For refugee numbers I chose line graphs, 
            emphasizing year-to-year changes, while I thought of water conflicts as more discrete and chose a bar graph. 
            I also decided that the overall visualization would be less cluttered if one of the three data series went 
            down, and felt that bars are more intuitive than a line. The idea of this plot is to assess whether spikes 
            in water conflicts align with more refugees from a country and/or fewer refugees in a country.<br><br>

            There were, of course, plenty of coding challenges that do not necessarily bear mentioning in detail. 
            The chord graph was the most difficult. I still have not completed it; I was unable to properly position 
            the legend or add labeling that did not overlap (due to some countries having very small arcs). Likewise, 
            the zooming scatterplot was too challenging for me to implement in time. There is also a bug with the colors
            on the water conflict bar chart changing after interacting with the chord diagram, which I will need to fix. I think my main takeaway was the 
            reminder that even if data does not end up supporting a hypothesis, it can still be interesting to work with!
